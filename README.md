SimpleWeatherApp 🌦️

A lightweight, user-friendly weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Get up-to-date weather information for your location with a clean and intuitive interface. 

# Key Features
Here are some of the key backend features I've implemented:
- 🔒 API Security: I've built a wrapper around external APIs to keep sensitive information, like API keys, hidden and prevent potential abuse. Security is always a top priority.
- 🌐 CORS Policy: To control who can access the weather data, I've added Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies, allowing only specific domains to use the API on their frontends. This ensures responsible and secure usage.

# TODO
Features include real-time weather updates, temperature, humidity, and a 5-day forecast. Easy to customize and deploy for your own weather needs. Stay informed with SimpleWeatherApp!
